# This sample shows how to use the built-in Copy codec preset that can take a source video file that is already encoded
# using H264 and AAC audio, and copy it into MP4 tracks that are ready to be streamed by the AMS service.
# This is useful for scenarios where you have complete control over the source asset, and can encode it in a way that is 
# consistent with streaming (2-6 second GOP length, Constant Bitrate CBR encoding, no or limited B frames).
# This preset should be capable of converting a source 1 hour video into a streaming MP4 format in under 1 minute, as it is not
# doing any encoding - just re-packaging the content into MP4 files. 
#
# NOTE: If the input has any B frames encoded, we occasionally can get the GOP boundaries that are off by 1 tick
#       which can cause some issues with adaptive switching.
#       This preset works up to 4K and 60fps content.
